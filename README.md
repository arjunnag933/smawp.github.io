# Stock-Market-Analysis-With-Python
Performing the Financial Analysis on Historic Stock Market Data such as calculating various risks, returns,etc.

1) Simple_n_Log_returns : It predicts the daily and annual returns(simple and logarithmic) based on historic data.

Note : Simple returns are taken into consideration when we are considering multiple stocks while Logarithmmic return for individual stock consideration.

2) Portfolio_returns : Predicting the combined returns of stocks in a portfolio.

3) Var_cov_correlation : The variance refers to the spread of the data setâ€”how far apart the numbers are in relation to the mean, for instance. Variance is particularly useful when calculating the probability of future events or performance.
A covariance refers to the measure of how two random variables will change together and is used to calculate the correlation between variables.
Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two or more variables fluctuate together.

4) Standard Deviation : Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean), or expected value i.e, what is the percentage that inverstors will be surprised by the result.

5) Div_non_Div_risk  : It calculates diversifiable risk and non-diversifiable risk i.e, risk that are beyond our control and risk that are organizational and can be controled.

6) Regression : The relation between house prices and house area is taken and checked how close is the relation with lots of characteristics to see from.

7) Markowitz_Algorithm : The algorithm that determines the best combination of weights in a pportfolio to get the minimum risk and maximum returns.

8) BETA and Beta_for_PG : Beta is a variable that tells about how much a stock moves with respect to the market.
If BETA < 1 then stock is defensive , if BETA > 1 then stock is aggressive, if BETA = 0 then there is no relationship.
